# Driving Song Recognizer in a nested shell

**Read `gnome-ext:nested-shell` first**: the loop (`start`, `do`, `reload`, `stop`), the
steps and its settings are there. This is what is particular to Song Recognizer.

```bash
./scripts/nested.sh start --headless     # Song Recognizer is ACTIVE when it returns
./scripts/nested.sh do "shot $S/top-bar.png 1100 0 500 32"
./scripts/nested.sh stop
```

- **Where it is**: an icon at the right of the top bar, left of the system menu.
- **Its settings**: `./scripts/nested.sh run gsettings --schemadir src/schemas set org.gnome.shell.extensions.song-recognizer show-indicator false`
  takes the icon away, in the nested shell's own settings.
- **Screenshots** go through `gnome-ext:screenshots`, under `start --stand-in`.
